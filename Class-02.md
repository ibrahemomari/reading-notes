## Paragraphs :
## < p>

```
<p>
To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.
By default, a browser will show
each paragraph on a new line
with some space between it and
any subsequent paragraphs.
Paragraph s
p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
line.</p>
<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
into units of text. For example, a book may have
chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
each heading there will be one or more
paragraphs.</p>
