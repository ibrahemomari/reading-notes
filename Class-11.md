# Images

HTML Images Syntax
The HTML < img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The < img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The < img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The < img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image


### The src Attribute
The required `src` attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads; it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.

```
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
```

## The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

```
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
```

### - Background Images:
 The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

### - background-repeat:
 The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn’t used).

### - Background Position:
 When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

  # Practical Information:

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject. The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can improve your website’s visibility on search engines.

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords:

#### - Page Title
#### - URL / Web Address
#### - Headings
#### - Text
#### - Link Text
#### - Image Alt Text
#### - Page Descriptions


# Flash, Video & Audio
Adding a Flash Movie to Your Web Page:

- The most popular way of adding Flash into a web page is using JavaScript. There are several scripts that allow you to do this without an in-depth understanding of the JavaScript language.

- The script we will be looking at here is called SWFObject. You can obtain a copy of it for free from Google, and you can see how we use it on the next page.


### How to Identify Keywords and Phrases :

1. `Brainstorm` List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.

1. `Organize` Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.

1. `Research` There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider.

1. `Compare` It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition.

1. `Refine` Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on. These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.

1. `Map` Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant, it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.
