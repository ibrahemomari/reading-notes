# 1. What is node.js?

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, and is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

***Node.js***
 is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.


 # 2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

 is open-source javaScript engine, used to excute th javaScript code at run-time , and its responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code.

 # 3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
thats mean we can execute javaScript code on our computer, thats mean when program is run.

# 4. What is npm?
***npm*** is the package manager for Node.js. It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.

# 5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

**v12.22.1**

# 6. What version of node are you running on your machine?

**6.14.12**


# 7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’? 

*Globally*
**`npm install -g jshint`**
*Locally*
**`npm install jshint`**


# 8. What is node used for?

* non-blocking
* event-driven servers
* traditional web sites and back-end API services

> most example to use node js:
>>Chat applications
>>Streaming applications
>>Command-line applications
>>Browser games
>>Embedded systems

# 1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

# 2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

All of this reasons are important, but I think the most beneficial one it's `Work environment readiness`, because we know all companies are when he works in a project, the project leader, divide the project into tasks and give every employee his tasks, so also the employe must work together and work in pair programming to achieve the project goals. 

# 3. How does pair programming work?

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the `Driver` and the `Navigator`. 
The **Driver** is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on he keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding.the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. 

The **Navigator** uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.




## Things I want to know more about 

I need to know more about dealing with server-side.
