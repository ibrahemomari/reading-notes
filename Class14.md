## Why diversity matters to your tech company

#### When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts. 

#### Why do diverse companies perform better?
 it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

 #### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.

example : in the facebook thier is an AI tecnology uses the mice or the sound reqrization so he know waht you are inersted for and show this content or like AD's to get benfite from user without make an effort mybe cuse an problems to facebook , and also the employees in facebook are dont needed to deal withe forms or qures or qustions with users to know what are intrested for and deal with a big data for a big social comminty in the world , thats make live easy and give the employees more effort also the company it self.
