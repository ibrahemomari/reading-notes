 AWS: S3 and Lambda
 === 

 You can use Lambda to process event notifications from Amazon Simple Storage Service. Amazon S3 can send an event to a Lambda function when an object is created or deleted. You configure notification settings on a bucket, and grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke a function on the function's resource-based permissions policy.

 Amazon S3 invokes your function asynchronously with an event that contains details about the object. The following example shows an event that Amazon S3 sent when a deployment package was uploaded to Amazon S3.

The cloud refers to servers accessed over the internet that store resources and software for computing and data storage.

#### What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
A container is like a bundle containing an application and everything it needs to run.

#### What is auto-scaling?
A cloud computing feature that allows cloud services to automatically scale based on traffic and utilization.

#### What is bandwidth?
Bandwidth is how much data can be transferred by an entity such as a network or hardware.

How do cloud providers compute service costs?
They charge based on the amount of usage of their services.
