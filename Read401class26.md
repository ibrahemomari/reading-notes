A **library** performs specific, well-defined operations.

A **framework** is a skeleton where the application defines the "meat" of the operation by filling out the skeleton. The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.

**Examples of libraries:** Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation, math. Operations are self-contained.

**Examples of frameworks:** Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system. The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about.

Document the following Vocabulary Terms
===



**Rendering**
is the process of gathering data (if any) and load the associated templates (or just send the output directly). Then apply the gathered data to the associated templates. The final output is sent to the user. This concept is quite the same for both client and server.

**Templates**
typically created in design software like Sketch or Photoshop. They are made up of common user interface elements such as buttons and navigation. They typically include core elements like icons, typography, colors, and sometimes complex UI patterns like grids, cards, and navigation. They are used to create mockups or prototypes of product solutions. Now let’s discuss why it’s important to use them.

**State**

States are visual representations used to communicate the status of a component or interactive element.
