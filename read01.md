# GROWTH MINDSET

### What is a growth mindset?

```
She is the self-belief she is capable of that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. 
A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

| EFFORT | Because he did not face challenges, his view of the tambourine is unclear, and he still has doubts  | Whoever wants to climb the peaks must endure the hardships of reaching  |
| CRITICISM  | He ignores the criticism directed at him and thus does not make new updates to his work  | He learns from criticism to see many paths to success  |
| SUCCESS OF OTHERS  | He sees himself as rigid and unreliable in his thinking  | He receives inspiration from others and tries to follow in their footsteps  |
